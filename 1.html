        The CIDOO V87 mechanical keyboard is a high-quality keyboard that offers a great typing experience with its
        gasket-mounted structure. The gasket-mount structure provides a smoother and more comfortable typing
        experience by reducing the impact of the keys on the baseplate. The gasket is made of an imported PORON adhesive
        foam
        strip, which helps to reduce noise and improve overall typing feel. This feature makes the CIDOO V87mechanical
        keyboard a great choice for anyone who spends long hours typing or gaming.

        The VIA programmable feature allows you to customize key functions, macros, and lighting to your liking. You can
        remap
        keys, create macros, and even adjust the RGB lighting effects, all through the VIA software. Whether you're a
        gamer who
        needs to remap keys, a programmer who needs macros, or just someone who wants to adjust the RGB lighting
        effects, the
        VIA software has got you covered.
