        <strong>THE UNCONVENTIONAL ALICE LAYOUT</strong><br>
        Step into a new dimension of typing comfort with the ergonomic Alice layout. The CIDOO ABM066 offers a uniquely
        contoured design that aligns with the natural positioning of your hands for enhanced ergonomics. The Alice
        layout offers a groundbreaking shift from traditional keyboard designs by providing a contoured, split layout
        that dramatically reduces the stress on your wrists and fingers. The shape is engineered to follow the natural
        curve of your hands as they rest on the keyboard, offering an intuitive and comfortable typing experience.

        open-source software offers an intuitive interface for real-time customization without requiring any coding
        skills. From key remapping and layer configurations to RGB customization and macro creation, VIA turns your
        keyboard into a highly personalized device.
